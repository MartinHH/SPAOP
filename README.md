# SPAOP

This is the project repository of SPAOP (Spatial Audio Object Positioner), an audio plugin to control audio object's positions within the [WONDER system for wave field synthesis](http://sourceforge.net/projects/swonder/).

It consists of a main VST/VST3/AU/RTAS plugin (built using the [JUCE](http://www.juce.com/) framework) and a helper application named the StreamMulticaster.

If you just cloned this repository, do not forget to fetch its submodules by entering `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` from the SPAOP repository's base directory (the same directory where you found this README.md).

For further information, have a look at the [Doxygen documentation](https://martinhh.github.io/SPAOP).
